# Planning

These documents provide useful information for planning TRAO observations, including:

- Statistical data on the empirical mapping capabilities of TRAO based on previous observations, which is essential for calculating on-source OTF mapping times
  - achievable sensitivity as a function of exposure time
- Methods for predicting practical observation times based on appropriate OTF mapping parameters
