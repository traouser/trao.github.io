The **Taeduk Radio Astronomy Observatory (TRAO)** is 
a 13.7-meter millimeter single-dish radio telescope 
operated by the **Korea Astronomy and Space Science Institute (KASI)**. 
Utilizing the 16-beam array SEQUOIA-TRAO receiver, 
TRAO can perform dual-channel mapping observations 
in the frequency range of 85-115 GHz with a velocity resolution of 0.05 km/s. 
TRAO can rapidly and efficiently map an area of several square degrees.

These documents provide useful information 
regarding observation planning, observing, data processing, and analysis 
for science for TRAO users.
